| Three of a Kind | 3 points |
| Straight | 4 points |
| Flush | 5 points |
| Full House | 6 points |

Hands not listed (e.g., High Card) score **0 points**.

### 7.2 Scoring Phase 1 (after Draw 1)
- All players reveal and compare hands.
- **Only one player scores:** the player with the best scoring hand.
- If no player has a scoring hand, **no points are awarded**.

### 7.3 Scoring Phase 2 (after Draw 2)
- Hands are compared again.
- **Only one player scores:** the player with the best scoring hand.
- If no player has a scoring hand, **no points are awarded**.

## 8. Comparing Hands (Tie-break Rules)

Suit ranking ensures **a single winner is always determined** when hands are otherwise equal.

### 8.1 General comparison order
1. Hand type
2. Relevant card ranks
3. Suit ranking (♠ > ♥ > ♦ > ♣) applied to the most relevant cards

### 8.2 Tie-break details

#### Pair
Pair rank → kickers (high to low) → suit of pair → kicker suits

#### Two Pair
Higher pair → lower pair → kicker → suits of higher pair → suits of lower pair → kicker suit

#### Three of a Kind
Trips rank → kickers → suits of trip cards → kicker suits

#### Straight
Highest card (A‑2‑3‑4‑5 counts as 5‑high) → suit of highest card

#### Flush
Compare cards from highest to lowest → suit if still tied

#### Full House (Special Rule)
Compare the **highest rank appearing anywhere in the hand**, regardless of whether it belongs to the pair or the three-of-a-kind. Then compare the other rank, then suits if needed.

#### Four of a Kind
Four-of-a-kind rank → kicker → suits of four cards → kicker suit

## 9. Trick-Taking Showdown (Last Trick Wins +5)

After Scoring Phase 2, players use their current 5 cards to play a 5-trick trick-taking game.

### 9.1 Trick rules
- Each player plays one card per trick.
- Players must **follow suit if possible**.
- Highest card of the led suit wins the trick.
- The trick winner leads the next trick.

### 9.2 Scoring
- **Only the 5th (final) trick matters.**
- The winner of the 5th trick gains **+5 points**.

## 10. Winning the Game ("Getting a Circle")

- When a player reaches **50 points or more**, they are said to have **"a circle"**.
- A player **cannot win during the same round** in which they first reach 50 points.
- Starting from the **next round**, a player with a circle can only win the game by **winning a Trick-Taking Showdown (the final trick)**.
- Multiple players may have a circle at the same time.
- The game continues until **one of the players with a circle wins a showdown**.
- If all players have a circle, the next showdown **must produce a winner** (whoever wins the final trick wins the game).

## 11. Clarifications

- Each scoring phase awards points to **at most one player**.
- Suit ranking prevents shared wins in scoring phases.
- The showdown is always worth **5 points** and is decided **only by the final trick**.
